# UFO Sightings 

## Project Overview
The purpose of the project is to use JavaScript to dynamically load a table of UFOs sightings. The user should be able to search based on date, city, state, country or shape. 


## Results 
When the user enters the page - they will have filters sections on the left side .

#### Searching 
Note: the search field is case sensitive and most data is lower case - so it's important to enter the criteria appropriately. 
 1. Enter search criteria into a field using the examples 
 2. Tab or hit enter and the data will refresh

#### Resetting the page 
To reset the page the user can clear out all the criteria or hit the menu which will reload the page with no search criterial applied.

## Summary 
The design has some  drawback and could be more user friendly. 

#### Drawbacks 
- User many not know how to trigger the search. It can be trigger by enter key or tab key. This may be confusing 
- Search is case sensitive - something the user would have to know. 

#### Recommendations 
- User interfaces needs more guidance. Possibly adding: 
	- Dynamically loaded drop down list 
	- Case insensitive search 
	- A search button that clearly lets the user filter 
	- A display of what the user is already filter on that allow them to remove the filter easily.
